# Mentorship 4 (Functional Programming Baby Steps through Haskell)

This mentorship is focused on learning the very basics of Haskell. There are "TODOs " where the mentee is expected to work on.


### Requirements

An installation of stack is needed. Further reference on: https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/

### Installation

After cloning this repository, and finishing the `TODO: ` marks the mentee should run the following:
```sh
$ stack setup
$ stack install
$ stack build
$ stack exec -- m4-exe

```
### Work

In order to finish this assignment the mentee should create the data structure `MyDataStructure` and make it an instance of Walkable as the `Arbol` Data Structure.
